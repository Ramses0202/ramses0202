        <h1>Travel to Japan</h1>
        
        <h2>Japanese culture</h2>
        
        <p>Japan's culture is the result of a historical process that began with the immigration waves originating from the Asian continent and the islands of the Pacific Ocean, followed by a strong cultural influence from China. Subsequently, the Tokugawa shogunate established a long period of isolation from the rest of the world (sakoku) in the middle of the 17th century, which lasted until the beginning of the Meiji Era, at the end of the 19th century, when it received an immense foreign influence that increased after the end of the Second World War. This in effect resulted in a culture distinct from other Asian cultures.

In Japan, personal interrelationships are strongly influenced by the ideas of "duty", "honor" and "obligation", a set known as giri (義理?), And which represents a custom different from the individualistic culture of Western nations. The concepts of "desirable behaviors" and "morality" are less practiced in family, school and friendship situations; however, a more formal practice is observed in front of superiors or unknown people.

One aspect that has played a significant role in Japanese culture is the Japanese language. Nemawashi (根 回 し?) Is also practiced, which refers to the careful and serious preparation of a project, which reflects the accepted and respected harmony within Japanese culture.

On the other hand, the Japanese possess an intricate and complicated sense of humor, which is highly reflected in culture, ethics, language, and religion, and which is sometimes considered to be very difficult to interpret by other cultures.<p>

<h3>Cultural characteristics</h3>

<h4>Conceptos</h4>

<p>The religions of Japanese culture have been influenced by the country, in addition to the original Shintoism, 5th century Buddhism, Taoism, and Confucianism, which have been in syncretic relationship. Confucianism has particularly affected social relationships and their hierarchy. Various concepts have been developed to describe the social structures of traditional Japanese society. There is a form of debt that an individual has to the surrounding people and the community in which he turned (義理?), While reciprocity. The principle, the duties that people have with each other. Unlike it is, giri can be an equal relationship. The opposite of this, ninjō (人情?), Denotes a person's personal feelings and desires. A similar contrast is the honne and tatemae (本 音 と 建 て 前?): The homne refers to a person's hidden desires and feelings, and the tatemae, the facade, the appearances and the behaviors shown to strangers. The contradiction between society's demands and real feelings is a common theme in Japanese literature, for example. Harmony in society is described by the term wa (わ?).
Another word for interpersonal relationships is uchi-soto (内外?). Uchi (内?) Means inside, soto (外?) Means outside. The groups are not static, but they vary greatly depending on the situation: the first ones can be your own family, colleagues or friends. The distinction between inner and outer circles is reflected in Japanese, which has approximately three levels of compliance: the inner group or, for example, the lowest "socially", at the lowest level, keigo (敬 語?) Which is the more respectful. Courtesy levels appear in verb endings, word choices, and respectful prefixes that accompany words.<p>
